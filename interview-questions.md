# Front-End Interview Questions
   
  There are some static questions which needs to be known by every front end Developer. I am listing down all those questions here. I will update this page whenever I find some new and interesting concept as a question so that we can keep on refreshing the concepts. Initally, I thought to maintain this page for me alone so that I can refer it whenever needed. Later I think others too can refresh their minds with this page.
  
  This page will be useful for freshers to learn the important concepts whereas for experienced, to test/refresh their minds. Happy Learning!!

*what is the difference between Function Expression and Function declaration?*

    Function Declaration defines a named function ie., "function" keyword followed by the name of the function. When using function declarations, the function definition is hoised,thus allowing the function to be used before it is defined.

      Syntax:
      ```
      function name(parameters) {
      // write logic here
      }
      ```
      ```
      Eg: function add(x, y) {
            return x + y;
          }
      ```
      Function Expressions defines a named or anonymous function. An anonymous function is a function that has no name. Function expressions are not hoised and therefore this function cannot be used before they are defined.
      In the below example, we are seeting anonymous function object equal to a variable

      Syntax:
      ```
      let name = function(parameters) {
                     //logic               
                  };
       ```
       ```
       Eg: var sum = function ( x, y) {
                        return x + y;
                     }

      ```
        _Calling a function:_ sum(5, 10);
